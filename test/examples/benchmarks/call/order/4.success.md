> - **Message**: Invalid URL parameter value on "id."
> - **Expected**: The "id" should be a string formatted as a UUID.
> - **Received Value**: The value provided as "sales-list-id" does not match this format, leading to the rejection of the request.

>
> UUIDs are critical in systems like this to ensure that each sale can be uniquely identified. A correct UUID format typically looks something like this:

Publish an order.

{@link IShoppingOrderPublish Publish} an {@link IShoppingOrder order} that
has been applied by the {@link IShoppingCustomer} with
{@link IShoppingAddress address} to delivery and payment information gotten
from the payment vendor system.

If the order has been discounted for entire order price, then no need
to send payment vendor info. Instead, only address info is required.

Also, the payment time can be different with the publish time. For example,
if the payment method is manual bank account transfer, then the payment
would be delayed until the customer actually transfer the money. In that
case, {@link IShoppingOrderPublish.paid_at} would be `null` value, so
that you have to check it after calling this publish function.

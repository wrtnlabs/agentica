> You tried to create a shopping cart commodity using the following parameters:

> - **stocks:** A list containing stock information for the commodity intended for purchase.
>     - **unit_id:** `macbook_unit_uuid` (ID for the sale unit)

> - **accumulate:** Set to `true`, signaling that if the same commodity already exists in the cart, the quantity should be accumulated instead of creating a new entry.

> ### Errors Encountered

> 
> ### Implication of Errors
> The system emphasizes that the provided values didn't comply with the expected types and formats. UUIDs are specifically utilized for identifying entities uniquely. This is essential for maintaining data integrity within the shopping cart system. Hence, ensure that the values passed for `sale_id`, `unit_id`, and `stock_id` are valid UUID strings.
> 
> ### Next Steps
> To successfully create the shopping cart commodity, review the values you are submitting, and replace them with valid UUIDs. After this adjustment, re-attempt the request to ensure that it adheres to the expected data format. If you need to acquire valid UUIDs, please consult your database or documentation.

> The function call to create a new order application for the shopping system has resulted in an error with a status code of 500, indicating an "Internal Server Error." 
> 
> ### Detailed Breakdown of the Response:
> 
> - **Status Code:** 500
> - **Message:** Internal server error
> - **Description:** This indicates that while attempting to execute the request to create a new order, the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. Such errors can happen due to various reasons, including issues within the server environment, problems with the logic of the application code, or unexpected exceptions that were not properly handled.
> 
> ### Possible Causes:
> 
> 1. **Database Issues:** There could be problems with connecting to the database, such as it being down or misconfigured, which prevents new orders from being recorded.
> 2. **Resource Limitations:** The server might be experiencing high loads, leading to failures in handling the request properly.
> 3. **Code Bugs:** There may be unhandled exceptions in the code responsible for processing the order creation logic, causing the server to crash at runtime.
> 4. **Incorrect Input Data:** The order creation request might contain parameters that violate business logic (though in this case, it appears an empty goods list was provided, which might not typically lead to an error but should be considered).
> 
> ### Next Steps:
> 
> - **Log Analysis:** Check the server logs for specific error messages that occurred during the execution of this request to gain insights into the root cause of the error.
> - **Testing:** Run isolated tests targeting the order creation functionality to reproduce the issue and determine if it stems from input parameters or internal application logic.
> - **Error Handling Enhancements:** Improve error handling in the code to manage exceptions better and provide meaningful feedback when inputs are incorrect or when the application encounters unexpected states.
> 
> In summary, addressing this internal server error would require a detailed investigation into the server's operational state at the time of the request, reviewing the relevant application logic, and possibly testing with different inputs that conform to expected parameters.

Publish an order.

{@link IShoppingOrderPublish Publish} an {@link IShoppingOrder order} that
has been applied by the {@link IShoppingCustomer} with
{@link IShoppingAddress address} to delivery and payment information gotten
from the payment vendor system.

If the order has been discounted for entire order price, then no need
to send payment vendor info. Instead, only address info is required.

Also, the payment time can be different with the publish time. For example,
if the payment method is manual bank account transfer, then the payment
would be delayed until the customer actually transfer the money. In that
case, {@link IShoppingOrderPublish.paid_at} would be `null` value, so
that you have to check it after calling this publish function.

### Describe
  - shoppings_customers_orders_publish_create

> The result of the function call to publish an order returned an error with a status code of 500. Here are the detailed insights into the situation:
> 
> ### Error Overview
> 
> - **Error Name**: `Error`
> - **Message**: `"Error on MigrateRouteFetcher.propagate(): number of parameters is not matched."`
> 
> This error message indicates that there was a problem processing the request to publish the order. Specifically, the issue arises from a mismatch in the expected number of parameters. This often occurs when required data is missing or incorrectly structured in the API request.
> 
> ### Understanding the Components
> 
> 1. **Error Context**:
>    - The term **MigrateRouteFetcher.propagate()** suggests that the issue is located within a specific function that handles routing or processing for the publishing action of the shopping order.
> 
> 2. **Possible Causes**:
>    - The parameters sent to the API may not match what the API expects.
>    - There may be missing fields in the request body which should contain details about the order and address.
>    - The `orderId` may have been incorrectly formatted or not provided.
> 
> 3. **Next Steps**:
>    - Review the parameters being sent in the API request to ensure that all required fields are present and correctly formatted.
>    - Ensure that the `orderId` is valid and corresponds to an existing order.
>    - Examine the API documentation to confirm that the request structure meets the expected format.
> 
> In cases where further debugging is needed, checks can be performed in the application log files to identify any other underlying issues or to view more detailed error messages.

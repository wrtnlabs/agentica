### Describe
  - shoppings_customers_sales_at

> The recent function call attempted to retrieve detailed information about a sale based on a provided sale ID. However, the operation was not successful due to an invalid parameter value for the sale ID.
> 
> ### Understanding of the Error
> 
> When calling the function to get a sale, the following details were expected for the `id` parameter:
> 
> - **Type**: String
> - **Format**: A UUID (universally unique identifier)
> 
> In this case, the ID provided was `"sales_list"`, which does not match the expected format of a UUID. Therefore, the system returned a 400 status code indicating a bad request.
> 
> Here is a breakdown of the response:
> 
> #### Response Details
> 
> - **Status**: `400` (Bad Request)
> - **Message**: `Invalid URL parameter value on "id".`
> - **Errors**:
>   - **Path**: `$input`
>   - **Expected**: `string & Format<"uuid">`
>   - **Received**: `sales_list`
> 
> ### Implications
> 
> This error suggests that in order to successfully retrieve information about a sale, a valid UUID must be provided as the sale ID. The sale ID represents a unique identifier for each sale, and without a proper UUID, the request cannot be processed.
> 
> ### Next Steps
> 
> To proceed, you should provide a valid UUID for the sale ID. If you have a specific sale you want to inquire about, please share the correct UUID so that I can assist you further in retrieving the detailed sale information.

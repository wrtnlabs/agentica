> ### Summary of the Response:
>
> - **Status Code**: 400 (Bad Request)
> - **Message**: The response indicated that there was an "Invalid URL parameter value on 'id'." Essentially, the value provided for the sale ID did not meet the expected requirements.
> - **Errors**: The specific error noted was that the input value did not align with the expected format:
>   - **Expected Type**: string with UUID format

> ### Example of the UUID Format
>
> A valid UUID looks like this: `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`.
>
> This type of error typically arises from either a typo in the ID, the wrong format being used, or a deprecated ID that’s no longer valid. To resolve this, please check the ID and ensure it complies with the UUID format before making a new request.
>
> If you wish to continue and need assistance with correcting the ID or further inquiries, feel free to ask!

#### shoppings_customers_orders_publish_create

- controller: shopping
- function: shoppings_customers_orders_publish_create
- reason: To publish the order and complete the payment with the user's provided address information.

Publish an order.

{@link IShoppingOrderPublish Publish} an {@link IShoppingOrder order} that
has been applied by the {@link IShoppingCustomer} with
{@link IShoppingAddress address} to delivery and payment information gotten
from the payment vendor system.

If the order has been discounted for entire order price, then no need
to send payment vendor info. Instead, only address info is required.

Also, the payment time can be different with the publish time. For example,
if the payment method is manual bank account transfer, then the payment
would be delayed until the customer actually transfer the money. In that
case, {@link IShoppingOrderPublish.paid_at} would be `null` value, so
that you have to check it after calling this publish function.

> - **Status Code**: `404 Not Found`
> - **Error Details**:
>   The error occurred because the operation relied on certain records that were not available in the database. Specifically, the `shopping_sales` record that your operation sought to reference doesn't exist. This could happen if:
>   - The `sale_id` you provided is incorrect or doesn't exist in the database.
>   - There may have been a problem with the database query, possibly due to malconfiguration or missing data.
>
> ### Implications
>
> Due to the `404` error, the operation to create the commodity in the shopping cart was unable to be completed. This means that:
>
> - No new commodity was added to your cart.
> - You will need to verify the `sale_id` you are using to ensure it exists in your database before attempting to create a new commodity again.
>
> ### Next Steps
>
> To resolve this issue, consider performing the following:
>
> 1. **Check the Sale ID**: Ensure that the `sale_id` you supplied (`ed70c7f4-0e3b-4e58-acd3-0648e946588a`) is correct and does indeed exist in your sales records.
> 2. **Query the Database**: If possible, manually check in the database for the existence of the record associated with the given `sale_id`.
> 3. **Error Logging**: If this error persists, it may be useful to implement some logging around your database queries to gather more context about why records might not be found.
>
> By ensuring the correctness of your data and better checking the state of your database records, you can avoid similar issues in the future.
>
> If you need further assistance debugging or correcting the input data, feel free to ask!

Create a new {@link IShoppingOrder order application} from a
{@link IShoppingCartCommodity shopping cart} that has been composed by the
{@link IShoppingCustomer}. Of course, do not need to put every commodities
to the order, but possible to select some of them by the customer.

By the way, this function does not mean completion the order, but means
just customer is applying the order. The order be completed only when customer
{@link IShoppingOrderPublish.paid_at pays} the order.

### Describe

- shoppings_customers_orders_create

> It seems that the attempt to create a new shopping order encountered an issue. The error message provided indicates that there was a problem with one of the commodities being referenced in the order.
>
> ### Error Details
>
> - **Error Code**: 422 (Unprocessable Entity)
> - **Error Message**:
>   - The first item in the order goods has a commodity_id of **2e217919-45f4-45f3-9712-d535b7efa7b3**.
>   - This commodity could not be found in the system. This suggests that the item either does not exist, has not been properly registered, or may have been removed from inventory.
>
> The underlying structure of the parameters involved in the order creation looks like this:

> ```mermaid
> graph TD;
>     A[Order Creation Request] -->|Contains| B[Goods List]
>     B --> C[Good 1: {commodity_id: "2e217919-45f4-45f3-9712-d535b7efa7b3"}]
>     C -->|Error: Not Found| D[Error 422: Commodity Not Found]
> ```
>
> ### Implications
>
> Due to this issue, the order creation process cannot proceed. The application will need to ensure that the commodity ID being used in the request is valid and corresponds to an existing product in the shopping mall's database.
>
> ### Next Steps
>
> 1. **Verify Commodity ID**: Check if the commodity ID **2e217919-45f4-45f3-9712-d535b7efa7b3** exists in the database.
> 2. **Add or Restore Commodity**: If it does not exist, consider adding it back to the inventory if it was mistakenly removed or was not registered correctly.
> 3. **Retry Order Creation**: Once the above steps are completed and the commodity is confirmed to be valid, you can attempt to create the order again.

Publish an order.

{@link IShoppingOrderPublish Publish} an {@link IShoppingOrder order} that
has been applied by the {@link IShoppingCustomer} with
{@link IShoppingAddress address} to delivery and payment information gotten
from the payment vendor system.

If the order has been discounted for entire order price, then no need
to send payment vendor info. Instead, only address info is required.

Also, the payment time can be different with the publish time. For example,
if the payment method is manual bank account transfer, then the payment
would be delayed until the customer actually transfer the money. In that
case, {@link IShoppingOrderPublish.paid_at} would be `null` value, so
that you have to check it after calling this publish function.

### Describe

- shoppings_customers_orders_publish_create

> The function call to publish an order returned an error, specifically a 500 status code, indicating that there was an internal server error. The error message states:
>
> ```
> Error on MigrateRouteFetcher.propagate(): number of parameters is not matched.
> ```
>
> This suggests that the function encountered an issue with the parameters being passed. The parameters required for publishing an order may not align with what was provided, leading to a failure in executing the function as intended.
>
> ### Context of the Function Call
>
> 1. **Objective**: The intention of this function call was to publish an order for delivery with specific address and contact information.
> 2. **Parameters**:
>    - **Address**: This includes details such as mobile number, name of the receiver, country, province, city, department, possession (specific location), zip code, and any special notes.
>    - **Vendor**: This would identify the payment vendor, which is crucial for processing the payment effectively.
>
> ### Implications of the Error
>
> - The mismatch in parameters indicates that either certain required fields were missing, or the data types did not match expectations. This highlights the importance of ensuring that all required fields are filled out correctly before making a function call.
> - It might be helpful to review the function's documentation to verify the exact structure and contents expected in the parameters.
>
> ### Next Steps
>
> To resolve this error:
>
> - Double-check the parameters being passed to ensure they meet the required specifications.
> - If you're consistently facing this error with the same parameters, you may want to reach out to the API support or check forums/documentation for similar issues reported by other users.
>
> By addressing these considerations, you should be able to successfully publish the order in the future.

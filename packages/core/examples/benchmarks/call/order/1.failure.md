### Describe

- shoppings_customers_orders_create

> The function call to create an order resulted in a **400 Bad Request** error. This indicates that the request made to create the order did not conform to the expected structure specified by the API.
>
> ### Details of the Error:
>
> - **Error Code**: 400
> - **Message**: "Request body data is not following the promised type."
>
> This message suggests that there was a problem with the input data sent in the request body for creating the order.
>
> #### Specific Issue:
>
> - The issue arose with the `goods` array in the request body. It contains an object where the `commodity_id` was expected to be a string in the format of a UUID.
> - **Problematic Value**: `"macbook-high-end-id"`
> - **Expected Format**: A valid UUID string.
>
> #### Understanding UUID:
>
> A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify information in computer systems. The format typically looks something like this:
>
> ```
> 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
> ```
>
> Therefore, the `commodity_id` should have a value conforming to this type instead of a simple string such as "macbook-high-end-id".
>
> ### Conclusion:
>
> In order to resolve this issue, ensure that the `commodity_id` provided in the request is a properly formatted UUID. After correcting this input, you can attempt to create the order again.
>
> If you need further assistance with forming the correct request body or understanding how to create a UUID, feel free to ask!

### Text (assistant)

To assist you better, let's start with retrieving the sales in the shopping mall and getting details about the MacBook. After that, we can proceed with selecting the most expensive stock and completing your order.

Please hold on for a moment while I fetch the information.

>
> The error indicates that the value provided for the `commodity_id` field in the goods list does not conform to the expected format. Specifically, the value `"uuid-of-the-most-expensive-macbook-stock"` is not recognized as a valid string formatted as a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).

> To resolve this issue:
>
> 1. **Check the `commodity_id`**: Ensure that you are using a correctly formatted UUID. This will generally involve retrieving the valid UUID from your system or database where the commodities are stored.
> 2. **Resubmit the Order Application**: Once a valid UUID is provided for the `commodity_id`, you can resubmit the order creation request.

### Describe

- shoppings_customers_orders_discountable

> The function call made to check the discountable information for a specific shopping order has returned an error response. Below is a detailed description of the response.
>
> ### Error Details
>
> - **Status Code**: `400`
> - **Message**: "Invalid URL parameter value on 'id'."
>
> This indicates that the provided `id` parameter for the order you queried is not valid. The URL was expected to contain a string formatted as a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier), but the function could not process the `id` that was given.
>
> #### Breakdown of Errors:
>
> - **Path**: This error is related to the URL that was constructed to call the function, specifically at the segment where the order ID should be.
> - **Expected Format**: The function expected a string that conforms to the UUID format but received something it could not validate, which in this case is "some-valid-order-id".
>
> ### Insight on UUID
>
> A UUID is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify information in computer systems. The standard format typically looks like this:
>
> ```
> 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
> ```
>
> ### Recommendation
>
> To resolve this error, ensure that you provide a valid UUID when calling the function. You can generate or validate UUIDs using various libraries or online tools if you are unsure of the format.
>
> In summary, the error indicates that the `id` you provided in your request is not in the expected UUID format, and you need to adjust this value to correctly retrieve discountable information linked to the specified order.

{@link IShoppingCartCommodity shopping cart} that has been composed by the

#### shoppings_customers_orders_publish_create

- controller: shopping
- function: shoppings_customers_orders_publish_create
- reason: To publish the order once it has been created.

Publish an order.

{@link IShoppingOrderPublish Publish} an {@link IShoppingOrder order} that
has been applied by the {@link IShoppingCustomer} with
{@link IShoppingAddress address} to delivery and payment information gotten
from the payment vendor system.

If the order has been discounted for entire order price, then no need
to send payment vendor info. Instead, only address info is required.

Also, the payment time can be different with the publish time. For example,
if the payment method is manual bank account transfer, then the payment
would be delayed until the customer actually transfer the money. In that
case, {@link IShoppingOrderPublish.paid_at} would be `null` value, so
that you have to check it after calling this publish function.

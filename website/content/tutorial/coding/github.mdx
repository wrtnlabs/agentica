## Introduction

This tutorial guides you through setting up a **fully functional Github Agent** using **Agentica**. With the following code block, you can create an agent that interacts with Github, powered by **OpenAI's GPT model**.

## The Complete Github Agent

First, install the required Github connector package:

```bash
npm install @wrtnlabs/connector-github
```

Then, add the following code to your project:

```typescript
import { Agentica } from "@agentica/core";
import { GithubService } from "@wrtnlabs/connector-github";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import OpenAI from "openai";
import typia from "typia";

dotenv.config();

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

export const GithubAgent = new Agentica({
  model: "chatgpt",
  vendor: {
    api: openai,
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  },
  controllers: [
    {
      name: "Github Connector",
      protocol: "class",
      application: typia.llm.application<
        Pick<
          GithubService,
          "searchUser" | "getUserProfile" | "getUserRepositories"
        >,
        "chatgpt"
      >(),
      execute: new GithubService({
        secret: process.env.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN!,
      }),
    },
  ],
});
```

## Github API Setup

Before running the agent, you need to configure your Github API credentials.

1. **Create a Github Application**  
   - You can create a new OAuth application by visiting either [Github Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) or Organization Application Settings.
   - Using an OAuth application allows you to obtain a token via login. This is optional, but if a token is used, the API ratelimit increases from the default 10 to up to 5,000, enabling more stable usage.

2. **Obtain Credentials**  
   - The Github token will start with `gho_`.
   - User permissions are required to use this token.
   - Although the API can be used without a token, the ratelimit is much lower; therefore, it is recommended to generate a token for more reliable usage.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**  
   - Add the following credentials to your `.env` file:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-github-access-token
   ```

Once this setup is complete, your Github Agent will interact with Github seamlessly.

## What This Does

With this configuration, the Github Agent can:

- **Process Github data**: Utilize the `GithubService` connector to handle Github-related data.
- **Leverage OpenAI's GPT model**: Use OpenAI's GPT model for intelligent interactions with Github.
- **Ensure type safety**: Maintain code type safety using `typia`.
- **Securely manage credentials**: Handle sensitive credentials safely with `dotenv`.

## Selecting Specific Functions

Using TypeScript's `Pick` utility type, you can restrict the functions exposed by `GithubService` to only those you need. For example, if you only want to use the `getUserProfile` function, you can configure your agent as follows:

```typescript
export const GithubAgent = new Agentica({
  model: "chatgpt",
  vendor: {
    api: openai,
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  },
  controllers: [
    {
      name: "Github Connector",
      protocol: "class",
      application: typia.llm.application<
        Pick<GithubService, "getUserProfile">,
        "chatgpt"
      >(),
      execute: new GithubService({
        secret: process.env.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN!,
      }),
    },
  ],
});
```

This ensures that the `GithubAgent` only has access to the selected function, improving security and maintainability.

## Example Response

When I asked the question:

> Create a brief resume by analyzing the profile, repository of the user "kakasoo".

The agent returned a concise summary indicating that the response included key details from the user's profile (basic info, repository statistics, pinned repositories, and insights) with personal data filtered for privacy.

## Available Functions

You can check the list of available functions in `GithubService` by reviewing the source code.

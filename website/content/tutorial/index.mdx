## Preface  

This tutorial guides you through setting up the foundation for developing multiple agents using **Agentica**. Regardless of whether an agent is designed for email processing, workflow automation, or data handling, there are common tasks that all agents must perform. This guide walks you through the essential setup process to establish a **consistent** and **scalable** development environment.  

### Project Setup  

First, create a new project folder and navigate into it.  

```bash
# Create a project folder
mkdir agentica-test

# Move into the project folder
cd agentica-test
```  

Next, initialize the project with **npm** to create a `package.json` file, which will manage project metadata and dependencies.  

```bash
# Initialize npm package.json
npm init -y
```  

### Installing Essential Packages  

Install **TypeScript** to enable type-safe development.  

```bash
# Install TypeScript
npm i --save-dev typescript

# Set up a TypeScript project (creates a tsconfig.json file)
npx tsc --init
```  

Now, install **OpenAI** and **Agentica Core**, which are essential for AI-powered agent development.  

```bash
# Install OpenAI package
npm i @openai

# Install Agentica Core
npm i @agentica/core
```  

### Setting Up Typia for TypeScript  

[**Typia**](https://github.com/samchon/typia) is a TypeScript plugin library that enhances type safety and serialization performance. It is particularly useful in agent-based systems that require structured data handling and precise type definitions.  

To install and configure Typia, run:  

```bash
# Install Typia (enhances type safety and serialization)
npm i typia

# Set up the project with Typia
npx typia setup
```  

### Managing Environment Variables (dotenv)  

To securely manage API keys and other sensitive information, use **dotenv** to configure environment variables.  

```bash
# Install dotenv package
npm i dotenv
```  

After installation, create a `.env` file in the project root and define environment variables as follows:  

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```  

You can then load these variables in your code using:  

```typescript
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const openaiApiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
console.log("OpenAI API Key:", openaiApiKey);
```  

### Why This Setup Matters  

This setup ensures that multiple agents can be developed in a **standardized** manner. Regardless of the agent's purpose, the following elements are essential:  

- **Structured development environment** (TypeScript & tsconfig)  
- **AI processing capabilities** (OpenAI API integration)  
- **Core agent framework** (Agentica Core)  
- **Efficient type handling** (Typia for serialization and validation)  
- **Environment variable management** (dotenv for API key security)  

By following these steps, all agents will share a **consistent architecture**, making it significantly easier to **scale**, **maintain**, and **extend** their functionality.

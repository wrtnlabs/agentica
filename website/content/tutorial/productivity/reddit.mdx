## Introduction

- [playground](https://stackblitz.com/github/wrtnlabs/agentica-tutorial-reddit?file=README.md) You can see the demo code on the playground.

Set up a **fully functional Reddit Agent** powered by OpenAI's GPT model quickly using the Agentica CLI.

## Quick CLI Setup

Launch the Agentica Setup Wizard with a single command:

```bash
npx agentica start reddit-agent
```

The wizard guides you through:

- Installing required packages (e.g., agentica@0.12.14)
- Choosing your package manager and project type
- Selecting the **REDDIT** controller
- Entering your `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Once complete, Agentica automatically generates your code, creates a `.env` file, and installs all dependencies.

## Generated Code Overview

The generated code looks like this:

```typescript
import { Agentica } from "@agentica/core";
import typia from "typia";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

import { RedditService } from "@wrtnlabs/connector-reddit";

dotenv.config();

const agent: Agentica = new Agentica({
  vendor: {
    api: new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY! }),
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  },
  controllers: [
    {
      name: "Reddit Connector",
      protocol: "class",
      application: typia.llm.application<RedditService>(),
      execute: new RedditService({
        secret: process.env.REDDIT_SECRET!,
        clientSecret: process.env.REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET!,
        clientId: process.env.REDDIT_CLIENT_ID!,
      }),
    },
  ],
});

const main = async () => {
  console.log(await agent.conversate("What can you do?"));
};

main();
```

This code instantly sets up your Reddit Agent, ready to intelligently interact with Reddit.

## What This Does

Your Reddit Agent will:

- **Interact with Reddit** using the `Reddit` connector.
- `getHotPosts` - Fetch the most popular posts.
- `getNewPosts` - Retrieve the latest posts.
- `getTopPosts` - Get top-ranked posts.
- `flatComments` - Fetch comments for a specific Reddit post.
- `getComments` - Retrieve comments for a specific Reddit post.
- `getUserAbout` - Fetch user information.
- `getUserSubmitted` - Retrieve posts submitted by a user.
- `getUserComments` - Get comments made by a user.
- `searchSubreddits` - Search for subreddits.
- `getSubredditAbout` - Retrieve subreddit details.
- `getPopularSubreddits` - Fetch a list of popular subreddits.
- `getBaseContent` - Retrieve base content.

- **Leverage OpenAI’s GPT model** for intelligent Reddit queries.
- **Ensure type safety** with `typia`.
- **Securely manage credentials** using `dotenv`.

Just set up your **environment variables** in a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
REDDIT_SECRET=your_reddit_refresh_token
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
```

To get these credentials:

1. **Create a Reddit App:**
  - Visit this [link](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) to create a Reddit App.
  - Create a Reddit App to get your `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` and `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`.
2. **Obtain Refresh Token:**
  - Generate a refresh token to get your `REDDIT_SECRET`.

## Use Case Example

Imagine you want to create a Reddit Agent that can:

> "Find the top posts in the r/Programming subreddit."

Your Reddit Agent can easily handle this request and provide you with the most upvoted posts in the r/Programming subreddit.

## Introduction

This tutorial guides you through setting up a **Notion Agent** using **Agentica**. With the code below, you can create an agent that interacts with Notionâ€”reading page lists, retrieving page contents, creating new pages, and updating existing pagesâ€”all powered by **OpenAI's GPT model**.

## The Complete Notion Agent

First, install the required Notion connector package:

```bash
npm install @wrtnlabs/connector-notion
```

Then, add or update the following code in your project:

> **Important:**  
> When modifying this code, be cautious as updates may overwrite existing content. Notion's API rate limits are relatively strict and block-based, so use update and creation functions with care. Used correctly, however, this tool is highly effective.

```typescript
import { Agentica } from "@agentica/core";
import { NotionService } from "@wrtnlabs/connector-notion";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import OpenAI from "openai";
import typia from "typia";

dotenv.config();

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

export const NotionAgent = new Agentica({
  model: "chatgpt",
  vendor: {
    api: openai,
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  },
  controllers: [
    {
      name: "Notion Agent",
      protocol: "class",
      application: typia.llm.application<
        Pick<
          NotionService,
          | "readPageList"
          | "readPageContents"
          | "createPageByMarkdown"
          | "updatePageContent"
        >,
        "chatgpt"
      >(),
      execute: new NotionService({
        secret: process.env.NOTION_SECRET_KEY!,
      }),
    },
  ],
});
```

## Notion API Setup

1. **Integration:**  
   - Create your integration at [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) and add your Private API Integration Secret to your `.env` file:
     ```env
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
     NOTION_SECRET_KEY=your-notion-secret-key
     ```

2. **Permissions:**  
   - During the integration setup, enable the required functionalities such as reading, updating, and creating pages (and comment management if needed).

3. **Data Sharing:**  
   - Share the relevant Notion pages or databases with your integration to grant access.

## What This Does

With this configuration, the Notion Agent can:

- **Retrieve a List of Pages:** Use `readPageList` to get your Notion pages.
- **Read Page Contents:** Retrieve detailed contents of a specific page via `readPageContents`.
- **Create New Pages Automatically:** Provide a topic or content in natural language. The agent will automatically summarize and format the input into Markdown and create a new page using `createPageByMarkdown`.
- **Update Existing Pages:** Modify page content based on your instructions using `updatePageContent`.

Leveraging OpenAI's GPT model, the agent translates natural language queries into API calls, enabling seamless interaction with your Notion workspace while ensuring type safety with `typia` and secure credential management with `dotenv`.

## Use Case Example

Imagine asking the agent:

> "Summarize the latest meeting discussion and create a new page with the summary."

The agent will process your natural language query by summarizing the content and then execute `createPageByMarkdown` to create a new page with the formatted summary. Similarly, you can update existing pages by issuing natural language commands.

 *
 * Currently, {@link Agentica} supports OpenAI SDK. However, it does
 * not mean that you can use only OpenAI's GPT model in the

 * LLM vendor's API, and you can use other LLM vendors by configuring
 * its `baseURL` and API key.
 *
 * Therefore, if you want to use another LLM vendor like Claude or
 * Gemini, please configure the `baseURL` to the {@link api}, and
 * set {@link IAgenticaController}'s schema model as "cluade" or
 * "gemini".

This library was created to enable even faster function selection.

In the existing Agentica, the Selector could take 1 to 2 seconds, but this library was developed to further reduce search time by leveraging Vector Semantic Search.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @agentica/pg-vector-selector
```

## Usage

Just replace the existing `executor.select` with the `selectorExecute` function.

```typescript
import { Agentica } from "@agentica/core";
import { AgenticaPgVectorSelector } from "@agentica/pg-vector-selector";

import typia from "typia";


// Initialize with connector-hive server
const selectorExecute = AgenticaPgVectorSelector.boot<"chatgpt">(
  'https://your-connector-hive-server.com'
);


const agent = new Agentica({
  model: "chatgpt",
  vendor: {
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    api: new OpenAI({
      apiKey: process.env.CHATGPT_API_KEY,
    }),
  },
  controllers: [
    await fetch(
      "https://shopping-be.wrtn.ai/editor/swagger.json",
    ).then(r => r.json()),
    typia.llm.application<ShoppingCounselor>(),
    typia.llm.application<ShoppingPolicy>(),
    typia.llm.application<ShoppingSearchRag>(),
  ],
  config: {
    executor: {
      select: selectorExecute,
    }
  }
});
await agent.conversate("I wanna buy MacBook Pro");
```

But this library depends on the `connector-hive` server.

You need to install the `connector-hive` server and to run it.

# PG Vector Selector

## Introduction
This library was created to enable even faster function selection in Agentica. While the existing Agentica Selector could take 1 to 2 seconds, this library significantly reduces search time by leveraging Vector Semantic Search technology.

Vector Semantic Search embeds text in high-dimensional vector space to search based on semantic similarity, allowing for more accurate and faster function selection compared to simple keyword matching.

Although there isn't a formal benchmark, we can see a significant reduction in test duration as shown below. The only difference between these two tests is the change in selector:

```md filename="Test Result"
- test_benchmark_call: 106,829 ms
- test_benchmark_call_pg_vector_selector: 1,775 ms
```

## Installation

```bash copy
npm install @agentica/pg-vector-selector
```

## Usage

Just replace the existing `executor.select` with the `selectorExecute` function.

```typescript copy
import { Agentica } from "@agentica/core";
import { AgenticaPgVectorSelector } from "@agentica/pg-vector-selector";

import typia from "typia";


// Initialize with connector-hive server
const selectorExecute = AgenticaPgVectorSelector.boot<"chatgpt">(
  'https://your-connector-hive-server.com'
);


const agent = new Agentica({
  model: "chatgpt",
  vendor: {
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    api: new OpenAI({
      apiKey: process.env.CHATGPT_API_KEY,
    }),
  },
  controllers: [
    await fetch(
      "https://shopping-be.wrtn.ai/editor/swagger.json",
    ).then(r => r.json()),
    typia.llm.application<ShoppingCounselor>(),
    typia.llm.application<ShoppingPolicy>(),
    typia.llm.application<ShoppingSearchRag>(),
  ],
  config: {
    executor: {
      select: selectorExecute, // Replace the existing selector
    }
  }
});
await agent.conversate("I wanna buy MacBook Pro");
```

### How It Works
`AgenticaPgVectorSelector` converts input text into vectors and uses PostgreSQL's pgvector extension to quickly find the most similar functions. The process works as follows:

1. User input or conversation context is converted into vectors
2. The system searches the database for function vectors most similar to the input
3. The function with the highest similarity score is selected and executed

## Connector-Hive Server Setup

This library depends on the `connector-hive` server. You need to install and run the `connector-hive` server.

Connector-Hive repository: https://github.com/wrtnlabs/connector-hive

### How to run connector-hive

If you don't have a PostgreSQL server with vector extension installed, you can use Docker to run it.

```bash copy
docker run -d \
  --name postgres-vector \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=your_user \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=your_database \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  pgvector/pgvector
```

Then, set up the environment variables file as follows:

```env copy
// .env
PROJECT_API_PORT=37001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_user:your_password@host.docker.internal:5432/your_database
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
API_KEY=your_optional_api_key  # Optional: If set, all requests except GET /health must include this key
```

```bash copy
docker pull ghcr.io/wrtnlabs/connector-hive:latest && \
docker run -d \
  --name connector-hive \
  --env-file .env \
  -p 37001:37001 \
  ghcr.io/wrtnlabs/connector-hive:latest
```

Now you can use the `connector-hive` server with the `pg-vector-selector` library:

```typescript filename="src/main.ts" copy
// Connect to connector-hive server running on localhost
const selectorExecute = AgenticaPgVectorSelector.boot<"chatgpt">(
  'http://localhost:37001'
);


const agent = new Agentica({
  model: "chatgpt",
  vendor: {
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    api: new OpenAI({
      apiKey: process.env.CHATGPT_API_KEY,
    }),
  },
  controllers: [
    await fetch(
      "https://shopping-be.wrtn.ai/editor/swagger.json",
    ).then(r => r.json()),
    typia.llm.application<ShoppingCounselor>(),
    typia.llm.application<ShoppingPolicy>(),
    typia.llm.application<ShoppingSearchRag>(),
  ],
  config: {
    executor: {
      select: selectorExecute,
    }
  }
});

// Start conversation
await agent.conversate("I wanna buy MacBook Pro");
```

## Performance Comparison

In typical use cases, PG Vector Selector is approximately 5-6 times faster than the traditional selector and provides more accurate function selection. The difference is especially notable for complex queries or large controller sets.

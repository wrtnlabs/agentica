## Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol for connecting LLM applications with various transports. Currently, MCP only supports tools functionality, while prompts and resources are not yet supported.

Here's a complete example of how to use it:

```typescript filename="src/main.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Agentica, assertMcpLlmApplication } from "@wrtnlabs/agentica";
import { StdioClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js";
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";

const client = new Client({
  name: "calculator",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

await client.connect(new StdioClientTransport({
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
  env: {
    GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: process.env.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    // Add other environment variables as needed
  }
}));

const agent = new Agentica({
  model: "chatgpt",
  vendor: {
    api: new OpenAI({ apiKey: "*****"})
    model: "gpt-4o-mini"
  },
  controllers: [{
    protocol: "mcp",
    name: "calculator",
    application: await assertMcpLlmApplication({ client }),
  }]
});
await agent.conversate("What can you do?");
```

## Transport Options

### Stdio Transport
The example above uses `StdioClientTransport` which is suitable for Node.js environments.

### SSE Transport
For Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections, you should use the `SseClientTransport` instead. This is particularly useful for web-based applications.

```typescript
import { SseClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/sse.js";

await client.connect(new SseClientTransport({
  url: "your-sse-endpoint"
}));
```

## Authentication

### Transport Authentication
For Stdio transport, you can pass environment variables to the child process:

```typescript
await client.connect(new StdioClientTransport({
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
  env: {
    GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: process.env.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    // Add other environment variables as needed
  }
}));
```

## Important Notes

### Connection Requirements
The `await client.connect()` call is mandatory. If you omit this step, the application will throw an error as the client needs to establish a connection before it can be used.

### Browser Compatibility
Note that `StdioClientTransport` uses Node.js's `child_process` module internally, which means it will not work in browser environments. For browser-based applications, you should use `SseClientTransport` instead.

### Feature Support
Currently, MCP only supports tools functionality. Prompts and resources are not yet supported in the current version.
